Typo II

TypoII is being developed for an IBM Wheelwriter 6 typewriter.  The idea is to be able to read from and write to the keyboard bus, enabling complete control of the typewriter.  For now, this will enable the typewriter to function as a paper-trail terminal to a computer, and I'll play text-adventure games on it.

Graph/ is an old prototype for visualizing the keyboard bus waveform

Record/ is an arduino sketch that records the keyboard bus waveform by using the ICP interrupt function

Speak/ is an arduino sketch that 'plays back' one of the waveform recordings from record, but also listens for ACK's from the controller board.
